<div class="tips">
  <h2>Do's</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>- action oriented (i.e. delete all contacts?)</li>
    <li>- short questions or statements</li>
    <li>- as a rule of thumb, place the positive button on the right, and the negative button on
the left</li>
    <li>- use descriptive, free standing labels such as "Connect"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dont's</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>- don't use negation in your question or statement</li>
    <li>- don't use it when the action is trivial and reversible. Use a toast instead.</li>
    <li>- don't use it when you want the user to make a trivial choices. Consider a select list instead.</li>
  </ul>
