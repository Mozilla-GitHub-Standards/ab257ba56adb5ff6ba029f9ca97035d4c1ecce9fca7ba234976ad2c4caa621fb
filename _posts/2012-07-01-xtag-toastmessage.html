description: "A toast is a small popup that either provides immediate and non-intrusive feedback on the user's action (email saved), or a notification of an event (new email). It contains very few text, does not require user interaction, and automatically disappears after a few seconds. It can include text, image, or both."
use_it: "When you want to provide information that does not require user input and when you are certain the user is focusing on the screen"
